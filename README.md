## Project Overview

**GreenGrow Collective** is a predictive analytics tool designed to assist farmers, corporations, and policymakers in making informed decisions related to agriculture and environmental sustainability. The project focuses on analyzing historical data and providing predictions about future environmental conditions, thereby empowering users to optimize their agricultural practices and improve sustainability efforts.

## Hackathon Participation

This project was developed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, a global hackathon that encourages collaboration among developers, designers, and data enthusiasts to create innovative solutions using NASA's open data. Our team utilized rich datasets provided by NASA to focus on agricultural and environmental indicators, enhancing agricultural practices and promoting sustainable development.

## Objectives

- **Innovation in Agriculture**: To provide actionable insights for farmers, agricultural businesses, and policymakers using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.
- **Open Data Utilization**: To promote the importance of open data initiatives, encouraging collaboration to address real-world challenges through technology.
- **Empowering Communities**: To offer tools and information that promote sustainable practices and improve crop yields in agricultural communities.
- **Fostering Global Collaboration**: To exemplify how diverse teams can unite to solve pressing issues through innovative technology.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting parameters such as country, year, and indicators.
- Interactive visualizations of data trends, predictions, and relevant environmental metrics.
- Predictive capabilities to forecast agricultural indicators based on historical data.
- Real-time predictions with a user-friendly output display.

## Dataset Information

The project utilizes various datasets, including:
- **Environmental Performance Index** (EPI)
- **Biodiversity metrics**
- **Carbon emissions data**
- **Water quality metrics**

Data credibility is ensured by using reputable sources and datasets provided during the NASA Space Apps Challenge.
